Uses the idea of Johansson and Gavel (1994), which is to create a \"Gaussian white noise process\" and apply a filter that shapes the noise to have a particular structure function. After this shaping the inverse FFT produces a matrix which contains the turbulent phase screen with the proper statistics, in this case Kolmogorov. Specifically, the output of the inverse FFT will be a random field which has the following spatial power spectral density:\n\nPhi_nleft(kapparight) = 0033 C_n^2 kappa^-113\n\nwhere kappa = 2pileft(f_xhati + f_yhatjright)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
